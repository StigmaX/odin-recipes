    <p>
      Pho (Phở) originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam. It is
      a Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, bánh phở (rice noodles), simple
      herbs and vegetables, and meat. The type of meat typically found in Pho is
      usually either phở gà (chicken pho) or phở bò (beef pho).

    <h2 class="secondHeading">Step to Make Pho</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pick a large enough bowl. YOU GUYS, Vietnamese noodle soup needs big
        bowls. Cereal bowls will not work here. Between the noodles and the
        broth and the veggies, bowls fill up fast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rice noodles first. Add your pre-cooked noodles first. Fill your bowl
        appropriately.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raw meat next. Yes, you guys. RAW. Totally, completely uncooked (see
        above). Remember how I mentioned slicing your beef super (paper) thin?
        This is why. Don’t worry, assuming your broth is boiling hot and not
        just warm, your meat will get fully cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the broth. It doesn’t matter which broth (the fast or the slow
        method), this is the moment. Just make sure it’s super hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish like crazy. Add cooked beef from the bones you used to make the
        bone broth, add one sauce…or five. Guys, it’s up to you!
      </li>
